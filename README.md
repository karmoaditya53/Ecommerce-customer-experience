# Ecommerce-customer-experience
Congratulations! You just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.  The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out! Let's get started!
conclusion
This is tricky, there are two ways to think about this: Develop the Website to catch up to the performance of the mobile app, or develop the app more since that is what is working better. This sort of answer really depends on the other factors going on at the company, you would probably want to explore the relationship between Length of Membership and the App or the Website before coming to a conclusion!
